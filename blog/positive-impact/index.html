<p>Have you ever thought about how much of your life is influenced by others? Or how much of an impact you might have on other people&rsquo;s lives? If you are like me, potentially not enough. Most of the time, I am quite absorbed in my own existence. How do I solve this problem for work, when am I going to eat, does he/she like me, are all not unfamiliar thoughts rumoring in my mind. There is not that much time left to focus attention on the people around. This is further enforced since I only encounter friends for short periods, e.g. while having lunch or on a phone call, until the fog of the unknown covers their lives again. As a consequence, the people around us make big leaps in their lives, so it seems. Behind the scenes, however, they do what we all do: Setting one step before another, one at a time. Today, I want to write about these steps - being it our own ones or our contribution to the steps of others.</p>
<p>It is easy to believe that we are all individuals who strive for their own goals, independent from others. Well, to some extent, we do precisely that. However, the other half of the story is <strong>how much the people around us influence us in these regards</strong>. You might have heard the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The limits of our language impact the limits of our world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My corpus of known words and the ways I am able to combine them set an upper limit to the thoughts I will have. My inner monolog is constrained by my personal dictionary. (Side note: I highly recommend Orwell&rsquo;s 1984 here for a more dystopian consequence of this.) Now, I want to take this concept one step further. And this is where the people around me come into play, since  - like language - <strong>they determine to a great degree which thoughts I can have, which solutions I have at hand to tackle challenges, and consequently which actions I will take.</strong> Without the boyfriend of my former flatmate, who cycled from Germany to India, never would I ever have thought about cycling further than 50 kilometers. Without my former boss, never would I have heard about the university I ended up writing my thesis.</p>
<p>Sometimes an idea strikes you, and sometimes it needs time to grow. Consequently, on some occasions, I was able to attribute a thought to a friend; sometimes, it became so intertwined with my personality that I cannot say whether it actually stemmed from somebody else. And up until this point, I might not be telling you new information. As you surely have heard, <strong>you become the average of the closest people around you</strong>, i.e., You = Average over your closest friends. I will call this the <strong>social impact equation</strong>. Coming back to the quote above, this implies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The limits of our circle of friends impact the limits of our world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But have you ever considered that <strong>you do not only enter this equation from the left but also the right? Thus, as the people around you determine your average, you are a crucial part of determining theirs.</strong> In quotable form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You impact the limits of somebody else&rsquo;s world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this was one of the insights which struck me during my last travels. I realized that not only are we influenced by others, but also do we influence our others - for the better or worse. Furthermore, I realized how hard our impact is to notice since it can be very subtle. Most of the time, you only see the surface of another person, viewing them as independent, while actually, <strong>you are in a highly entangled and fluid relationship</strong>. Thus, here some examples of situations where I noticed how my environment suddenly repeated specific ideas of mine. First, the other day I talked with one of my friends in Zurich about the purpose of LinkedIn (which is sales, in my eyes). A few days later, he had written his first ever LinkedIn post. Another example? Just a couple of months back, I talked with my flatmate about a potential perspective of employment, namely viewing yourself as a one-person company whose responsibility it is to solve problems for your client (other people will call your boss). A week later, she dropped in a casual conversation how well her one-person business is flourishing.</p>
<p>Moments like this give me an idea of how my words and deeds directly impact the people in my surroundings. Perhaps with this article, I even expanded the borders of your world a little bit. So, as a little (hopefully enjoyable) homework, try to notice which quirks you might have adopted from your friends, and - more importantly - <strong>which of your quirks you can find in their behavior. Be mindful of the inevitable impact you have on your surrounding</strong> - it is your responsibility to assess whether you enter others impact equation positively or negatively. Are you supportive or pull others down with your constant negative comments? <strong>Especially over several years, consider that your little interactions can go a long way for others.</strong></p>
