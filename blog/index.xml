  Have you ever thought about how much of your life is influenced by others? Or how much of an impact you might have on other people&amp;rsquo;s lives? If you are like me, potentially not enough. Most of the time, I am quite absorbed in my own existence. How do I solve this problem for work, when am I going to eat, does he/she like me, are all not unfamiliar thoughts rumoring in my mind.</description>

      <description>My value wall. I blurred the details since some texts are quite personal. If you want to know how I define a specific value, simply ask me;) However, if you are really interested in my style of formulating them, I included the template for two banners (including text) at the bottom.
  While I was bike touring last year, I happened to stumble (i.e., pedal :D) into the beautiful city of Stockholm.</description>

      <description>Fully loaded bike in front of Lund University.
  Last year, I traveled by bike for three months. Everything I needed, I could fit either into one of my four bags or over the rack (as you can see above). Even though it feels like I experienced more during those three months than during a typical year, the days were quite routinized. Wake up, meditate, have breakfast, pack the tent, cycle for 70-120 km, search for a spot to spend the night, set up the tent, have dinner, write journal, and fall asleep.</description>
