<p>While I was bike touring last year, I happened to stumble (i.e., pedal :D) into the beautiful city of Stockholm. Since I enjoy couchsurfing whenever I visit a new place, I also reached out to several people this time. One of them was Erik. Even though I did not end up staying with him, we met up for a Fika (typical Swedish coffee break). During the next hours, we ended up chatting about various topics. Especially one of them sparked a long discussion: <strong>values and their purpose</strong>. Until then, I had heard about values on some occasions but had never given the topic more profound thought. It was quite an interesting discussion, and since there is not that much else to do on a bike, the encounter with Erik got me thinking during the next weeks. I will not talk about how to find/define your values; there is already a plethora of great resources out there. However, I want to underline what values mean to me (greatly inspired by Erik) and why it mattered to have them visually written down.</p>
<p>For Erik, <strong>the purpose for values was rooted in two things</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A shortcut to decide for/against certain activities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A filter for which people to surround yourself with.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s address this separately. First, being aware of my values (and having them written down) allows me to shortcut decisions on which activities I want to participate in - no struggling while evaluating pro and contra lists, eventually resulting in decision fatigue. <strong>I can look at a printed list of my values, and will know whether I would enjoy the time spent in a particular activity.</strong> However, we all (including me) have a bad day or week from time to time. It is hard to make a decision that aligns with your values when all you want to do is lie in bed and watch Youtube videos (my default mode during ego depletion). <strong>However, having my values in visible form might give me enough of a push in the right direction</strong>. And these tiny moments decide whether I will work on exciting stuff from my Trello list or ride down Youtube alley for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>Second, values act as a filter for the people I enjoy spending my time with. <strong>Being aware of my values help me in realizing when my thoughts do not align with certain parts of my environment.</strong> As you can see above, I am a person who highly values physical health. Connecting with other people who share the joy of being physically active is a lot easier and boosts my motivation. Solely being surrounded by people who prefer to skip exercise-day would undermine my drive over the long run, resulting in me feeling unwell. Did I thus cancel all friendships which do not align with all of my values? Hint: Rhetorical question;) The above example only considers one dimension, i.e., physical health. There are many more value dimensions out there, each being (subconsciously) weighted differently by us. For example, if you do not care about minimalism, you assign zero weight to it. And this is fine. <strong>I believe there is something to learn from (almost) everybody, and that person might have a refreshingly different perspective on individual dimensions.</strong> However, if I see that another person is at different ends in too many dimensions (active vs. lazy, positive vs. negative thinking, disciplined vs. slackish, &hellip;), I will eventually reduce the time spent around this person. Ever wondered why we are drawn to some people while not to others? <strong>Being aware of your values can help you root why you value the time with specific people (new encounters or old friends) and consequently reach out to them more regularly.</strong></p>
<p>After leaving Stockholm and continuing my journey through the forests of Sweden, I finally put more effort into figuring out what I value in life. It was a slow-moving and challenging thought process, but eventually, you can see the outcome in the image on top of this article. <strong>Since the banners are visible from all over my room, I feel how they subconsciously nudge my thinking and decisions.</strong> Perhaps this tweak is of value for you, too. As a reward for sticking with me until this point, please find the template to create your ones <a href="../resources/ValuesTemplate.pptx">here</a>. Give it some thorough thought about what you value (even up to a few weeks or months), and then feel free to edit and/or create your own ones. Ensure that each picture and text has a personal meaning to you!</p>
