  Have you ever thought about how much of your life is influenced by others? Or how much of an impact you might have on other people&amp;rsquo;s lives? If you are like me, potentially not enough. Most of the time, I am quite absorbed in my own existence. How do I solve this problem for work, when am I going to eat, does he/she like me, are all not unfamiliar thoughts rumoring in my mind.</description>
