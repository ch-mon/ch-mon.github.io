      <description>Fully loaded bike in front of Lund University.
  Last year, I traveled by bike for three months. Everything I needed, I could fit either into one of my four bags or over the rack (as you can see above). Even though it feels like I experienced more during those three months than during a typical year, the days were quite routinized. Wake up, meditate, have breakfast, pack the tent, cycle for 70-120 km, search for a spot to spend the night, set up the tent, have dinner, write journal, and fall asleep.</description>
