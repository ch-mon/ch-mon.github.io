      <description>The first principal component shows hifh correlation with the order parameter.
  Background This project is concerned with the work of my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis. During the four months, I investigated the phase transition of the Ising model with machine learning and applied the same methodology to another statistcal model. Hereby, apart from a pratical course during the studies, I had never worked with machine learning before, so this was a great opportunity to dig deeper into the topic.</description>
