  Background During my time at ETH Zurich, I had the chance to participate in the two month-long sustainability Hack4Good program. This hackathon was organized by the Analytics Club and the Student Project House at ETH. Five teams would be presented with challenges and data offered by different NGOs and try to solve the former within the given timeframe. Each of the projects had the focus on sustainability and was pro-bono.</description>
