  Background During my time at ETH Zurich, my team (big shout-out to Frederike LÃ¼beck, Kaoru Schwarzenegger, and Vincent Bardenhagen) and I had the chance to participate in the two-month-long sustainability Hack4Good program. This hackathon was organized by the Analytics Club and the Student Project House (SPH) at ETH. Five teams would be presented with challenges and data offered by different NGOs and solve the former within the given timeframe.</description>

  Background During quarantine, some friends (Pano Herbe and two more) and I decided to tackle an exciting project. It was concerned with training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize certain fashion articles in Instagram pictures. The final goal was to identify fashion objects from Instagram influencers, create potentially traffic-generating keywords, and use them for Google Ads marketing. This service would be especially valuable for data-driven fashion retailers who want to increase their click-through and conversion rate.</description>
