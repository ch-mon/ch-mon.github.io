  Background During quarantine, some friends and I decided to tackle an exciting project. It was concerned with training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize certain fashion articles in Instagram pictures. The final goal was to identify fashion objects from Instagram influencers, create potentially traffic-generating keywords, and use them for Google Ads marketing. This service would be especially valuable for data-driven fashion retailers who want to increase their click-through and conversion rate.</description>

      <description>The first principal component shows high correlation with the order parameter.
  Background This project is concerned with the work of my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis. During the four months, I investigated the phase transition of the Ising model with machine learning and applied the same methodology to another statistical model. Hereby, apart from a practical course during the studies, I had never worked with machine learning before. Thus, this was a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topic.</description>
