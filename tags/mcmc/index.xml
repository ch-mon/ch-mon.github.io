      <description>The first principal component shows high correlation with the order parameter.
  Background This project is concerned with the work of my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis. During the four months, I investigated the phase transition of the Ising model with machine learning and applied the same methodology to another statistical model. Hereby, apart from a practical course during the studies, I had never worked with machine learning before. Thus, this was a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topic.</description>
