<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>During quarantine, some friends (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-herbe/">Pano Herbe</a> and two more) and I decided to tackle an exciting project. It was concerned with training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize certain fashion articles in Instagram pictures. The final goal was to identify fashion objects from Instagram influencers, create potentially traffic-generating keywords, and use them for Google Ads marketing. This service would be especially valuable for data-driven fashion retailers who want to increase their click-through and conversion rate.</p>
<h2 id="project-description">Project description</h2>
<p>We started with the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html">Google Open Image Database</a> and trained a <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">Yolo-V3</a> CNN in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google Colab</a> to recognize 25 different fashion articles (e.g. dresses, watches, &hellip;) on several thousands of pictures. Afterward, we scraped images from selected Instagram influencer accounts and used the trained CNN for classification of fashion articles in those images. Then, we cropped the detected items and identified the main color via a k-means clustering algorithm. Finally, we were able to build a keyword of the form &ldquo;Influencer name + main color + fashion article&rdquo; (e.g. &ldquo;David Beckham Golden Watch&rdquo;). We also built a small front-end for the CNN classification using <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>. In the next paragraph, I discuss what would happen to the keyword after generation.</p>
<p>The whole project is based upon one assumption: <em>Influencer Instagram posts with fashion articles lead to increased search volume for this article in the consecutive hours/days</em>. First, we tried to verify this thesis manually, however then moved on to apply an automated Google Trends Mapping. We queried the keyword to GoogleTrends via a Python-API (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/">PyTrends</a>) and checked for any significant peaks in the search interest. In contrast, in production, one would directly use the obtained keyword for Google Ads. The whole project pipeline is illustrated below.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We brought the project to a point where the pipeline could be executed from one main file. The algorithm would receive a list of Instagram accounts, automatically generate the keywords from the scraped images, and create plots from Google Trends data.</p>
<p>An example of a classified image is shown in the first picture of this post. Here, the CNN detected the watch with 94% confidence. One might wonder why the shoe is not classified as well, since it is also well visible. This results from the fact that our training categories did not involve shoes directly but rather the more specialized forms &ldquo;boot&rdquo;, &ldquo;high heel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sandal&rdquo;. Since our focus laid on creating a Proof of Concept (PoC), of course, more categories are a natural extension.</p>
<p>However, at this point, we encountered more severe difficulties. First,  Google Trends data has to be interpreted with care since it only gives you a relative number of search queries. Until now, we still had no way of objectively verifying our basic assumption that our keywords would actually generate more traffic. Second, often the CNN would (correctly) recognize items that were almost invisible or not in the main focus of the image. Even a CNN with 100% accuracy would not be able to decide upon the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of keywords (i.e. keywords from items that receive little to no traffic due to not being in the focus of the picture). Due to these two impediments, which we could not resolve with our resources, we decided to end the project here and take it as a great learning experience.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>To conclude, for me, the project was a fascinating chance for learning more about &ldquo;real&rdquo; data science. We had to dig into different solutions for the arising challenges during development. I was able to strengthen my skills in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming
<ul>
<li>Python &amp; corresponding packages
<ul>
<li>Pandas, Selenium, Pillow, PyTrends, Streamlit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Google Colab interaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Methodological
<ul>
<li>Web scraping</li>
<li>Training of &amp; classifying with state-of-the-art image recognition models (CNNs)</li>
<li>Basic frontend-setup for Data Science projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Code is currently still private (&amp; messy), however, we work on making it public soon.</p>
