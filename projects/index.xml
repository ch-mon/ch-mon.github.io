  Background During quarantine, some friends (Pano Herbe and two more) and I decided to tackle an exciting project. It was concerned with training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize certain fashion articles in Instagram pictures. The final goal was to identify fashion objects from Instagram influencers, create potentially traffic-generating keywords, and use them for Google Ads marketing. This service would be especially valuable for data-driven fashion retailers who want to increase their click-through and conversion rate.</description>

<p>During quarantine, some friends (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-herbe/">Pano Herbe</a> and two more) and I decided to tackle an exciting project. It was concerned with training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize certain fashion articles in Instagram pictures. The final goal was to identify fashion objects from Instagram influencers, create potentially traffic-generating keywords, and use them for Google Ads marketing. This service would be especially valuable for data-driven fashion retailers who want to increase their click-through and conversion rate.</p>
<h2 id="project-description">Project description</h2>
<p>We started with the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html">Google Open Image Database</a> and trained a <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">Yolo-V3</a> CNN in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google Colab</a> to recognize 25 different fashion articles (e.g. dresses, watches, &hellip;) on several thousands of pictures. Afterward, we scraped images from selected Instagram influencer accounts and used the trained CNN for classification of fashion articles in those images. Then, we cropped the detected items and identified the main color via a k-means clustering algorithm. Finally, we were able to build a keyword of the form &ldquo;Influencer name + main color + fashion article&rdquo; (e.g. &ldquo;David Beckham Golden Watch&rdquo;). We also built a small front-end for the CNN classification using <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>. In the next paragraph, I discuss what would happen to the keyword after generation.</p>
<p>The whole project is based upon one assumption: <em>Influencer Instagram posts with fashion articles lead to increased search volume for this article in the consecutive hours/days</em>. First, we tried to verify this thesis manually, however then moved on to apply an automated Google Trends Mapping. We queried the keyword to GoogleTrends via a Python-API (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/">PyTrends</a>) and checked for any significant peaks in the search interest. In contrast, in production, one would directly use the obtained keyword for Google Ads. The whole project pipeline is illustrated below.</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We brought the project to a point where the pipeline could be executed from one main file. The algorithm would receive a list of Instagram accounts, automatically generate the keywords from the scraped images, and create plots from Google Trends data.</p>
<p>An example of a classified image is shown in the first picture of this post. Here, the CNN detected the watch with 94% confidence. One might wonder why the shoe is not classified as well, since it is also well visible. This results from the fact that our training categories did not involve shoes directly but rather the more specialized forms &ldquo;boot&rdquo;, &ldquo;high heel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sandal&rdquo;. Since our focus laid on creating a Proof of Concept (PoC), of course, more categories are a natural extension.</p>
<p>However, at this point, we encountered more severe difficulties. First,  Google Trends data has to be interpreted with care since it only gives you a relative number of search queries. Until now, we still had no way of objectively verifying our basic assumption that our keywords would actually generate more traffic. Second, often the CNN would (correctly) recognize items that were almost invisible or not in the main focus of the image. Even a CNN with 100% accuracy would not be able to decide upon the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of keywords (i.e. keywords from items that receive little to no traffic due to not being in the focus of the picture). Due to these two impediments, which we could not resolve with our resources, we decided to end the project here and take it as a great learning experience.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>To conclude, for me, the project was a fascinating chance for learning more about &ldquo;real&rdquo; data science. We had to dig into different solutions for the arising challenges during development. I was able to strengthen my skills in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming
<ul>
<li>Python &amp; corresponding packages
<ul>
<li>Pandas, Selenium, Pillow, PyTrends, Streamlit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Google Colab interaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Methodological
<ul>
<li>Web scraping</li>
<li>Training of &amp; classifying with state-of-the-art image recognition models (CNNs)</li>
<li>Basic frontend-setup for Data Science projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Code is currently still private (&amp; messy), however, we work on making it public soon.</p>

            <description>The first principal component shows high correlation with the order parameter.
  Background This project is concerned with the work of my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis. During the four months, I investigated the phase transition of the Ising model with machine learning and applied the same methodology to another statistical model. Hereby, apart from a practical course during the studies, I had never worked with machine learning before. Thus, this was a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topic.</description>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This project is concerned with the work of my <strong>Bachelor&rsquo;s thesis</strong>. During the four months, I investigated the phase transition of the Ising model with machine learning and applied the same methodology to another statistical model. Hereby, apart from a practical course during the studies, I had never worked with machine learning before. Thus, this was a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topic. Moreover, the thesis formed my first real contact with the Python programming language.</p>
<h2 id="project-description">Project description</h2>
<p>First, we began by reproducing the previous work of other researchers (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.022140">Wetzel, 2017</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823">Metha et. al., 2018</a>) and learned the order parameter of the 2D Ising model. Hereby, we relied on two different approaches: <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> and <strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</strong>. In the next step, we applied the same methodology to another physical model, the so-called rod-model (<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4960618">Oettel et. al., 2016</a>). For both models, the necessary training configurations were generated via <strong>Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)</strong> sampling.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We were able to show that even for the new model, the machine learning methods can extract the order parameter by themselves (see plot above).</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>For me, the thesis provided an excellent opportunity to explore the domain of machine learning. The most important learnings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming
<ul>
<li>Python &amp; corresponding packages
<ul>
<li>Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, Scikit-Learn</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Linux Shell interaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Methodological
<ul>
<li>Unsupervised machine learning</li>
<li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
<li>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</li>
<li>Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>During my time with the student consultancy InOne Consult e.V. in Tuebingen, I had the chance to work on several exciting projects. Amongst one of them was developing a Social Media Marketing Strategy for a local real estate investment fund. The N.E.S.T.bau AG (short nestbau) plans, builds, and rents out flats in the Tuebingen region under the guidance of ethical principles. Here, N.E.S.T. is an acronym for the German words &ldquo;Sustainable. Ethical. Safe. Transparent.&rdquo;. The CEO realized that he was operating in a saturated market investor-wise and thus approached us to develop a Social Media Marketing Strategy to address younger generations.</p>
<h2 id="project-description">Project description</h2>
<p>We structured the 3.5 month-long project into the four different phases shown below.</p>

<h4 id="induction-phase">Induction phase</h4>
<p>During the induction phase, we familiarized ourselves with the provided material. We clearly defined our goal using the <strong>SMART method</strong> (i.e., making our goal Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Bound). Furthermore, we used a <strong>project canvas</strong> to become aware of our current position, essential milestones, and available resources.</p>
<h4 id="market-analysis">Market analysis</h4>
<p>The market analysis was subdivided into several aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the <strong>stakeholder analysis</strong>, we highlighted the most relevant players in the market segment and attained actionable measures for each of them.</li>
<li>During the <strong>competitor analysis</strong>, we obtained deep insight into the current field of real estate investment funds and the position of nestbau in it. Quickly, it became apparent that only a few investment funds pay value to social return on investment.</li>
<li>The insights we obtained so far were used during a <strong>SWOT (Strength-Weaknesses-Opportunites-Threads) analysis</strong> to become aware of both strengths and weaknesses and how they potentially can benefit or harm nestbau.</li>
<li>Further, we conducted <strong>legal research</strong> due to regulatory issues regarding the direct advertisement of stocks.</li>
<li>In <strong>interviews with current investors</strong>, we obtained further insights into the motives of investing in nestbau.</li>
<li>In the next step, we channeled much of the before obtained knowledge to identifying the <strong>USP (Unique Selling Point)</strong> of nestbau.</li>
<li>Lastly, we derived so-called <strong>Personas</strong>, which later helped us addressing the hopes and potential fears of the target audience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stragegy-development">Stragegy development</h4>
<p>During the strategy development, we distilled all of the collected knowledge to derive concrete actions on how to best present the identified USP to our personas. Therefore, we worked out concrete methods, such as <strong>They-Ask-You-Answer (TAYA)</strong> or <strong>Search-Engine-Optimization (SEO)</strong>, to generate traffic and engage with the audience. Moreover, we <strong>identified concrete channels and the most suitable content</strong> for each of them. We condensed this knowledge into one of our final deliverables: the <strong>strategy paper</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="strategy-implementation">Strategy implementation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A strategy is only as good as its implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we also implemented most of the recommended measures. More precisely, this involved <strong>setting up a net of Social Media channels</strong> and linking them amongst each other. Each account would be prefilled with <strong>content for the first weeks</strong>, ensuring a smooth transition to nestbau.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>During the project and after the final presentation, we received highly positive feedback on our work from nestbau. In the end, even two additional projects for InOne Consult evolved from this cooperation. After pitching this project to the JCNetwork (a national student consultancy association), we got awarded the best project of the year by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).</p>
