<p>My name is Chris (actually Christoph, but simply call me Chris) and I warmly welcome you on my website. If I had to summarize myself in one sentence, it would be the following: I am a character who is driven by a <strong>strong passion for learning &amp; utilizing the newest technologies</strong> (it is crazy what is currently happening out there), while on the other hand trying to <strong>retain balance in the fast-paced environment of our today&rsquo;s world</strong>. Luckily, I got more than a sentence, and thus I want to motivate this website and its structure with the following story.</p>
<p>In 2018, during my time at Toastmasters International in Cologne, I gave several speeches. One of them was about Curriculum Vitae (CVs) and my opinion about them. The main takeaway was: <strong>CVs are comparable to a mask</strong>. A mask that we put on when we are on the internet or in a job interview. Those masks distill on a high-level who we are. And there is nothing wrong with this. As long as we stay aware of the purpose of CVs.</p>
<p>If you visit my LinkedIn profile, you will probably see the following Alter-Ego of mine: Former Physics student at EKU Tuebingen; got involved in Consulting during studies &amp; several internships; currently living in Switzerland and writing his Master&rsquo;s thesis at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, we often judge people to quickly based upon their mask, thinking that we know which label to attach to them. <strong>We never get the full story, those nitty-gritty turns &amp; most shaping experiences that underlie those CV milestones</strong>. CVs reduce us to our most important stations and technical skills. Sometimes, there is a tiny section about your hobbies in the end. Nevertheless, I believe there is so much more to us that remains under the surface. That is why I decided to create this website. <strong>To give you a more rounded view onto who I think I am, what fascinates me, and what my interests are beyond work and university</strong>. I want to give you the chance to look behind my mask.</p>
<p>In my <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>, I write about past and present thoughts, experiences, and ideas. The <a href="/personal/">Personal</a>  page illustrates what I am currently doing and lists some of my most shaping experiences of the last years. The <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page summarizes some interesting challenges I worked on. Since I love reading, feel free to rummage through my <a href="/reads/">Reads</a> to see which books influence and have influenced me.</p>
